Total lines in file:      8,509 (before cleanup: 8,509 -> after: 8,500)

--- FALSE POSITIVES FOUND & REMOVED (9 domains) ---

The following 9 domains were legitimate services and have been REMOVED
from the blocklist:

  1. github.com                 - Source code hosting platform (Microsoft)
  2. gitlab.com                 - Source code hosting platform
  3. bitbucket.org              - Source code hosting platform (Atlassian)
  4. archive.org                - Internet Archive, non-profit digital library
  5. raw.githubusercontent.com  - GitHub raw file CDN
  6. cdn.discordapp.com         - Discord official CDN
  7. t.me                       - Telegram official short-link domain
  8. pastebin.com               - Text sharing service (dual-use but legitimate)
  9. bashupload.com             - File upload service (dual-use but legitimate)

NOTE: These are dual-use services. Threat actors abuse them for hosting
malware/C2, but blocking the root domain blocks ALL legitimate use.
Recommendation: Use URL-level or path-based rules instead.

  FILE 2: Bad_IP_Address.txt
===============================================================================

Total unique IPs:         39,743

--- FALSE POSITIVES FOUND & REMOVED (2 IPs) ---

  1. 192.168.1.10   - RFC 1918 private IP address, not routable on the
                       public internet. Should NEVER appear in a public
                       IOC blocklist. Likely added by mistake from an
                       internal log or example.

  2. 13.107.246.77  - Microsoft Corporation CDN infrastructure IP.
                       Part of Azure Front Door / Microsoft Edge network.
                       Serves cdn.winget.microsoft.com, Minecraft auth
                       services (sessionserver.mojang.com), and other
                       legitimate Microsoft services.
                       Confirmed by: WHOIS (AS8075 Microsoft), web search,
                       IP reputation score 0/100 (clean).

--- NOTE ON CLOUD PROVIDER IPs ---

  The list contains IPs from major cloud providers:
  - ~73 IPs in Microsoft Azure ranges (52.x, 20.x, 13.107.x)
  - ~134 IPs in Google Cloud ranges (35.x, 34.x)
  - ~312 IPs in potential AWS ranges (3.x, 18.x, 54.x)

  These are NOT false positives. Cloud providers host both legitimate
  and malicious infrastructure. Attackers commonly use cloud VMs for
  C2 servers, phishing hosts, and malware distribution. These IPs were
  sourced from URLhaus/ThreatFox/INCD and represent specific malicious
  instances on cloud infrastructure, not the providers themselves.

  EXCEPTION: 13.107.246.77 is a Microsoft-owned CDN service IP (not a
  customer VM) and was incorrectly included.

--- OVERALL ASSESSMENT ---

  - 99.99% of IPs (39,741 out of 39,743) correctly flagged as malicious
  - 2 IPs are FALSE POSITIVES (removed)

  TOTAL                  |    59,846  |      11         |  99.98%

  ACTIONS TAKEN:
  - Removed 9 false positive domains from FQDN_list.txt
  - Removed 2 false positive IPs from Bad_IP_Address.txt
  - Hash lists (MD5, SHA1, SHA256) - no changes needed

  RECOMMENDED FOLLOW-UP:
  1. Add a whitelist filter for known legitimate domains/IPs in the
     auto-fetch pipeline to prevent future false positives
  2. For dual-use services, implement URL-level blocking instead of
     domain-level blocking
  3. Periodically re-audit cloud provider IPs as their assignments
     may change over time
