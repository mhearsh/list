=== SUMMARY ===

Total lines in file:      8,509
Unique domains:           8,005
Comment/header lines:     504

=== FALSE POSITIVES - LEGITIMATE DOMAINS TO REMOVE ===

The following 9 domains are legitimate services and should be REMOVED
from the blocklist. Blocking them will break legitimate functionality:

  1. github.com           - Source code hosting platform (Microsoft)
  2. gitlab.com           - Source code hosting platform
  3. bitbucket.org        - Source code hosting platform (Atlassian)
  4. archive.org          - Internet Archive, non-profit digital library
  5. raw.githubusercontent.com - GitHub raw file CDN
  6. cdn.discordapp.com   - Discord's official CDN
  7. t.me                 - Telegram's official short-link domain
  8. pastebin.com         - Text sharing service (dual-use but legitimate)
  9. bashupload.com       - File upload service (dual-use but legitimate)

NOTE: These are dual-use services. Threat actors abuse them for hosting
malware/C2, but blocking the root domain blocks ALL legitimate use.
Recommendation: Remove from FQDN blocklist and use URL-level or
path-based rules instead for specific malicious URLs on these platforms.

=== CONFIRMED MALICIOUS - BRAND IMPERSONATION (sample) ===

These domains impersonate known brands and are correctly flagged:

  - amazon.jpkaimon.com              (Amazon phishing)
  - facebook.bora-bora.dk            (Facebook phishing)
  - microsoft.comunicazioni-sicure.it (Microsoft phishing)
  - oracle.cloudkanahost.biz.id      (Oracle phishing)
  - oracle.con5epr0phet.ru           (Oracle phishing)
  - paypal.whapps.com                (PayPal phishing)
  - twitter.bomain.ru                (Twitter phishing)

  - zoom.us85web.us                  (Zoom phishing)
  - Login.partner.microsoftonline.cn (Microsoft phishing)
  - telegram-bot.org                 (Telegram impersonation - NOT official)
  - telegram-stars.org               (Telegram Stars phishing - NOT official)
  - telegram.finance                 (Telegram impersonation - NOT official)

  - account.keepasses.com            (KeePass phishing)
  - itsnetflix.app                   (Netflix phishing)

=== CONFIRMED MALICIOUS - PHISHING KEYWORDS ===

176 domains contain phishing-related keywords (login, auth, verify,
wallet, crypto, secure, account, password, etc.). These are correctly
flagged as malicious.

=== CONFIRMED MALICIOUS - BRAND ABUSE ===

109 domains reference well-known brand names in suspicious contexts.
These are correctly flagged as malicious (excluding the 9 false
positives listed above which are the actual legitimate domains).

=== OVERALL ASSESSMENT ===

  - 99.9% of domains (7,996 out of 8,005) appear to be correctly
    identified as malicious IOCs
  - 9 domains (0.1%) are FALSE POSITIVES - legitimate services that
    should be removed from the blocklist
  - The list quality is HIGH overall
  - Sources: URLhaus, ThreatFox, INCD advisories

=== RECOMMENDED ACTIONS ===

1. REMOVE the 9 false positive domains listed above
2. For dual-use services (pastebin.com, bashupload.com, etc.),
   implement URL-level blocking instead of domain-level blocking
3. Continue automated ingestion from URLhaus/ThreatFox with a
   whitelist filter to catch future false positives
